# Example Usage

This repository exists as an example of what a typical workload for 
my [thesis project](https://github.com/UnfamousThomas/thesis-initial) would look like.

## Structure
In ./server/ You can see a simple Minestom Minecraft server implementation,
that by default blocks deletion for a few minutes.

In ./service/ You have some metric based scaling logic that can be used by a Game Autoscaler.
